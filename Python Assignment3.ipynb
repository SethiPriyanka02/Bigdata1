    "1)Validating user input: When your program accepts input from a user or another source, you can use exception processing to validate that the input is in the correct format and meets certain criteria. For example, you can use exception handling to check that a user has entered a valid email address, or that a number they have entered is within a certain range.\n",

    "2)Handling network and file operations: When your program performs operations on external resources, such as a network or a file system, there is a risk that the operation could fail due to a network outage, a file not being found, or other issues. Using exception processing, you can handle these failures gracefully and provide feedback to the user, or take other appropriate actions.\n",

By using try-except blocks and raising specific exceptions, you can identify and isolate specific problems in your code, and test how your code behaves when it encounters those problems.
